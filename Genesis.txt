History for Genesis
===================

2.0.1
-----
* moved AmiTCP:bin/AmiTCP.kernel to AmiTCP:kernel/AmiTCP
  make sure you also rename the file appropriately.
* Added debug mode: see prefs/options. logfiles go to t:
* lo0 (127.0.0.1) is configured automatically at startup.
* inetd is started at startup, not just when going online

2.0.2
-----

* fixed very lame bug that prevented to go online a second
  time with ppp without terminating genesis first.
* "Speed" gadget now displays contents of modem's "CONNECT"
  string (more useful than baudrate, eh ?)
* AmiTCP now gets started properly => genesis can be started
  from WB too.

2.0.3
-----

* inetd now gets started properly too from WB.
* if tcp: is already mounted it won't be mounted again.
* added notification on config file => when changes are saved
  it will be reloaded. requester will popup if an iface is
  still online (can't switch config with iface online).
* ifaces with "Always Online" set now will be set online
  when isp is beeing switched too.
* added option "ShowStatusWindows  yes/no" if user doesn't
  want status windows to be opened (at startup or at going
  online)
* readded serial output terminal (who requested that again ? :)


2.1.0
-----

* mucho travacho ! :)
* added OwnDevUnit support.
* the events "Online", "OnlineFail", "OfflineActive" and
  "OfflinePassive" now belong to the interfaces (no longer to
  global config) and commands now get executed. (also see prefs).
* Xon/Xoff can now be enabled/disabled.
* highspeed mode (RAD_BOOGIE) can now be enabled/disabled.
* only one instance of genesis can be started.
* replaced "on/offline" icon with lamps for each interface.
  (lamp design from Voyager - and thanks for the help Olli !)
* removed lame bug that made Genesis crash when putting
  ifaces offline.
* if interface is "always online" it will now be put online at
  startup too.

2.1.1
-----

* fixed bogomil's "crash on 2nd exit" bug.
* increased timeout for amitcp launch for those with an
  increddible HUGE s:User-Startup :)

2.1.2
-----

* now supports more than 2 nameservers and more than 1
  domainname.
* user name is now set correctly: "whoami" and "AmIRC" get the
  correct name if it was defined in db/passwd (but that's gonna
  be automated soon anyway).

2.1.3 (30.3.98)
---------------

* fixed bug that caused an enforcer hit when adding nameservers to
  amitcp:db/resolv.conf . should also solve the problem of adding
  empty entries to this file.
* now reads configuration correctly (again).

2.1.4 (4.4.98)
---------------

* now reads amitcp:db/passwd to get user information. user stuff in
  genesis.conf has been dropped. => run genesisprefs first, verify
  user information and save. otherwise you'll see strange things in
  isp and user lists.
* startup-event is launched after "always online" ifaces are set
  online => samba should work now.
* added menu entry to start prefs from genesis... yessss ! :)

2.1.5 (6.4.98)
--------------

* increased wait time for amitcp-kernel at startup to 30 secs
  (certain people use to have huuuuge user-startups ! :)
* fixed enforcer hit which occured when "always online" and
  "iconified at startup" were selected. The cause was term.mcc
  which doesn't like to get called when the window is iconified.
* startup and shutdown got parsed wrong. the leading number (which
  indicated the type (0:cli, wb, script, 3:rexx) was included into the
  commandline.
* to start genesisprefs from menu it has to be in AMITCP:, PROGDIR: or
  in the path and its name must be "GenesisPrefs".

2.1.6 (20.4.98)
---------------

* a stupid bug prevented genesisprefs to be launched when it wasn't
  in AmiTCP:
* multiple phonenumbers are supported (separated with a '|').
* displays how many seconds remain in redial delay.

2.1.7 (30.4.98)
---------------

* env:apppdns1 was not deleted (misspelled filename in DeleteFile())
  and thus they were probably reused after switching the provider config.

2.1.8 (4.5.98)
--------------

* added SynClock functionality (gettime / savetime).
* launches 68020 version of AmiTCP if available and applicable.

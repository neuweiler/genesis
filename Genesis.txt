History for GENESiS
===================


1.0.0 (06.12.98)
----------------

* first official release.


1.0.1 (30.12.98)
----------------

* destination IP address obtained by bootp is now beeing used.
* cleaned up handling of IP addresses.
* added new switch: if genesis is terminated, the global user can be
  flushed (see genesis prefs).
* added new switch: NoAutoTraffic - genesis and other programs should
  supress any automatic network traffic. So auto-dialup interfaces (e.g.
  isdn cards, routers, etc.) don't establish an unnecessary connection
  at startup.
  If the file ENV:NetConfig/NoAutoTraffic exists other applications
  should also suppress any automatic traffic.
  The disadvantage is that automatic detection of vapor-updates doesn't
  work when this switch is enabled.
* now the names of the interfaces which have to be put online at startup
  can be passed as cli/wb arguments (ONLINE). e.g. "genesis ppp0 magplip0"
* "confirm disconnect" now works.

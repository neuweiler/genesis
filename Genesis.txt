History for Genesis
===================

2.0.1
-----
* moved AmiTCP:bin/AmiTCP.kernel to AmiTCP:kernel/AmiTCP
  make sure you also rename the file appropriately.
* Added debug mode: see prefs/options. logfiles go to t:
* lo0 (127.0.0.1) is configured automatically at startup.
* inetd is started at startup, not just when going online

2.0.2
-----

* fixed very lame bug that prevented to go online a second
  time with ppp without terminating genesis first.
* "Speed" gadget now displays contents of modem's "CONNECT"
  string (more useful than baudrate, eh ?)
* AmiTCP now gets started properly => genesis can be started
  from WB too.

2.0.3
-----

* inetd now gets started properly too from WB.
* if tcp: is already mounted it won't be mounted again.
* added notification on config file => when changes are saved
  it will be reloaded. requester will popup if an iface is
  still online (can't switch config with iface online).
* ifaces with "Always Online" set now will be set online
  when isp is beeing switched too.
* added option "ShowStatusWindows  yes/no" if user doesn't
  want status windows to be opened (at startup or at going
  online)
* readded serial output terminal (who requested that again ? :)


2.1.0
-----

* mucho travacho ! :)
* added OwnDevUnit support.
* the events "Online", "OnlineFail", "OfflineActive" and
  "OfflinePassive" now belong to the interfaces (no longer to
  global config) and commands now get executed. (also see prefs).
* Xon/Xoff can now be enabled/disabled.
* highspeed mode (RAD_BOOGIE) can now be enabled/disabled.
* only one instance of genesis can be started.
* replaced "on/offline" icon with lamps for each interface.
  (lamp design from Voyager - and thanks for the help Olli !)
* removed lame bug that made Genesis crash when putting
  ifaces offline.
* if interface is "always online" it will now be put online at
  startup too.

2.1.1
-----

* fixed bogomil's "crash on 2nd exit" bug.
* increased timeout for amitcp launch for those with an
  increddible HUGE s:User-Startup :)

2.1.2
-----

* now supports more than 2 nameservers and more than 1
  domainname.
* user name is now set correctly: "whoami" and "AmIRC" get the
  correct name if it was defined in db/passwd (but that's gonna
  be automated soon anyway).

2.1.3 (30.03.98)
----------------

* fixed bug that caused an enforcer hit when adding nameservers to
  amitcp:db/resolv.conf . should also solve the problem of adding
  empty entries to this file.
* now reads configuration correctly (again).

2.1.4 (04.04.98)
----------------

* now reads amitcp:db/passwd to get user information. user stuff in
  genesis.conf has been dropped. => run genesisprefs first, verify
  user information and save. otherwise you'll see strange things in
  isp and user lists.
* startup-event is launched after "always online" ifaces are set
  online => samba should work now.
* added menu entry to start prefs from genesis... yessss ! :)

2.1.5 (06.04.98)
----------------

* increased wait time for amitcp-kernel at startup to 30 secs
  (certain people use to have huuuuge user-startups ! :)
* fixed enforcer hit which occured when "always online" and
  "iconified at startup" were selected. The cause was term.mcc
  which doesn't like to get called when the window is iconified.
* startup and shutdown got parsed wrong. the leading number (which
  indicated the type (0:cli, wb, script, 3:rexx) was included into the
  commandline.
* to start genesisprefs from menu it has to be in AMITCP:, PROGDIR: or
  in the path and its name must be "GenesisPrefs".

2.1.6 (20.04.98)
----------------

* a stupid bug prevented genesisprefs to be launched when it wasn't
  in AmiTCP:
* multiple phonenumbers are supported (separated with a '|').
* displays how many seconds remain in redial delay.

2.1.7 (30.04.98)
----------------

* env:apppdns1 was not deleted (misspelled filename in DeleteFile())
  and thus they were probably reused after switching the provider config.

2.1.8 (04.05.98)
----------------

* added SynClock functionality (gettime / savetime).
* launches 68020 version of AmiTCP if available and applicable.

2.1.9 (07.06.98)
----------------

* moved back from stormc to sasc => 31% smaller code..
* localized everything and added help bubbles.
* user now log in by using genesis.library
* also asks for user at startup
* moved some internal functions to genesis.lib => requires at least
  genesis.library from 7.6.1998

2.1.10 (08.06.98)
-----------------

* user popup now has its own user list again. so if no password is
  set, no requester will appear at all when changing user.
* corrected display bugs when certain gagdets in main window are
  hidden.
* workaround to prevent term.mcc causing a massive enforcer hit
  attack when its window isn't opened or its MUIA_ShowMe was FALSE.

2.1.11 (15.06.98)
-----------------

* now supports new netconnect.library
* at startup tries to login with global user, if not set, tries to
  login with first defined user. If this user has no passwd set, no
  login requester will appear.
* added arexx interface :
   provider     : NAME,FORCE/S
                  switch to provider 'name'. if 'force' is passed,
                  and one iface is still online no requester will appear
                  but it will go offline immediately.
                  (case sensitive ! use single quotation marks)
   user         : NAME,PW=PASSWORD/K
                  change logged in user to 'name'. if password is known,
                  you can pass it along with 'password'. A requester
                  will only appear if required.
                  (case sensitive !)
   connect      : IF=IFACENAMES/M,ALL/S
                  like pressing "connect" button. if no name is given
                  and only one iface is defined, it will be put online.
                  if more than one are defined, a requester will popup.
                  if you pass interface names (i.e. 'ppp' 'magplip0')
                  they will be put online. you can pass more than one
                  iface name. 'all' will put all ifaces online.
                  (case insensitive)
   disconnect   : IF=IFACENAMES/M,ALL/S
                  like pressing "disconnect" button. if no name is given
                  and only one iface is defined, it will be put offline.
                  if more than one are defined, a requester will popup.
                  if you pass interface names (i.e. 'ppp' 'magplip0')
                  they will be put offline. you can pass more than one
                  iface name. 'all' will put all ifaces offline.
                  (case insensitive)
   isonline     : IF=IFACENAME
                  return online status of given iface. if no name is given,
                  the status of the first iface is returned (in rc).
                  TRUE = online, FALSE = offline, -1 = error
                  (case insensitive)
   window       : OPEN/S,CLOSE/S
                  open or close the mainwindow. this will really open/close
                  the window. It will not iconify it (like SHOW / HIDE).

2.1.12 (22.06.98)
-----------------

* startup command now gets executed after kernel was loaded and BEFORE inetd
  is launched. this allows samba to install properly.
* added CLI/WB arguments: USER, PASSWORD, WAITSTACK
  user & password are used to login as a specific user at startup
  waitstack is how many seconds genesis waits til amitcp is ready.

2.1.13 (22.06.98)
-----------------

* when argument parsing failed, mui app didn't get disposed => could not be
  launched again.
* added cli/wb argument PROVIDER to load a provider at startup.
* made a few modifications in serial_waitfor() to hopefully
  correct a problem with long delays (reported by wiz).
* redesigned about requester.

2.1.14 (24.06.98)
-----------------

* added network status window, can be opened by using the menu.
  it shows iface name, on/offline, ip, dest ip, gateway ip.
* when more than one iface is defined and only one of them can be put
  on/offline, the iface requester will no longer popup.

2.1.15 (01.07.98)
-----------------

* as a workaround "ATZ\r" is beeing sent before the init-string. this should
  help to avoid problems with some crappy modems.
* fixed problem with dialscript... this time for real !

2.1.16 (05.07.98)
-----------------

* modified about & copyright texts. included "thanks to" part. If someone
  thinks (s)he has been missed, please let me know.
* added Delay(10); after each command that's sent to the modem. could fix
  problems with pace modem.
* launching genesisprefs from menu should no longer throw up "inser volume
  PROGDIR:" requester.

2.1.17 (06.07.98)
-----------------

* debugged detecetion of iface that goes offline by itself (passive).
* now supports execution of programs/scripts if iface has been put online,
  if an iface failed to go online, if an iface was put offline by the
  user and if the iface went offline by itself (e.g. carrier drop with ppp)
* "always online" is now "auto online" which means that the iface gets online
  when the config is loaded but the user can put it offline/online manually
  too.
* changed behaviour of interface requester slightly. now: default multiselect
  and double click supported.
* inetd, lo0 and tcp: will only be loaded/mounted when user specified
* now properly reloads config when changed with prefs.

2.1.18 (06.07.98)
-----------------

* some of the new options (StartupTCP, ...) didn't get loaded correctly.

2.2.0 (09.07.98)  NetConnect II version
----------------

* full version for NC2
* wb-tooltypes were not parsed correctly, cause after cloning the global path,
  genesis thought it was started from cli and not from wb.
* provider-name passed as argument no longer case sensitive.
* added 1 hour session-timout in demo mode
* added 90 days demo timeout, incl. 10 additional days with warning.
* at startup the about requester pops up in demo mode.
* added help bubbles for iface led's to display iface name.

2.2.1 (03.08.98)
----------------

* removed sending of ATZ again and increased time to wait for modem responses
  to 3 secs. (didn't realize that some modems take that much time to respond
  until I got a pace modem :)
* added support to reconnect dialup ifaces after crash but unfortunately it
  doesn't work with ppp.
* added menu options to show/hide window gadgets (settings/display).

2.2.2 (03.09.98)
----------------

* added support for genesislogger.library
* many internal changes for dhcp
* dhcp in alpha test - unstable !

2.3.0 (24.09.98) Italian amiga show version
----------------

* removed dhcp stuff temporarely, put bootp in again
* default route is always set to the first iface that is online.
* GenesisREPORT can be launched from menu.
* added support for time restriction: user cannot login at given
  times/days or will be disconnected (after 10min, 5min and 1min warnings)
* added support for online time limit: user can stay online a given
  amount of time only and will be disconnected (after 10min, 5min and
  1min warnings).
* added support for genesis' own keyfile system.
* about window now says if program was compiled for NC

2.3.1 (28.09.98)
----------------

* external call of amitcp:bin/syncclock has been replaced by internal
  functions.
* now asks given time server to verify time and check user's time
  restrictions. If no servername is specified, the isp's default is
  used. If an error occurs, the check falls back to the internal clock.
* corrected but in arexx iface: if the command "connect" or "disconnect"
  was issued without any argument, genesis would block.
* changed arg template to arexx function "isonline" : "IF=IFACENAME,ANY/S"
  if "any" is specified then the number of ifaces that are online is
  returned. the rest stays the same.

2.3.2 (29.09.98)
----------------

* to hangup, genesis now checks if after DTR drop a CD is still present.
  if so, it sends +++ ATH0.
* to possible solve some problems with certain providers or configurations
  now ifaces get configured first, the default route is set to the first
  iface that is online and then nameservers are configured and the
  hostname is queried and at last the domainnames are configured.
  This happens every time you put an iface online.
  If at nameserver-configuration no dns is set, genesis falls back to two
  root nameservers.
  So genesis no longer needs a primary interface. Only the order of the
  ifaces in the list is important since the first iface that is online
  is used to set the default gateway.
* arexx: ISONLINE now returns 1 = iface online, 2 = iface is currently
  connecting, 0 = iface is offline

2.3.3 (01.10.98)
----------------

* finally found bug with multi phone numbers: after connecting, it tried
  to dial next.
* when iconified and config was changed while online, genesis just terminated
  all connections without poping up a requester. now, it deiconifies which
  has the result that the requester should appear.

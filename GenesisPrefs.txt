History for GenesisPrefs
========================

2.0.1
-----

* Data entered in Gateway, Destination and Netmask still got
  lost. Now every option available in the prefs should get
  saved.
* minor gui rearrangements in interface section.
* Added debug mode: see prefs/options. logfiles go to t:
* options not supported yet by genesis have got ghostes icons
  now.

2.0.2
-----

* hostname setting (dynamic/static) fixed.. was wrong way round
* "secret" and "user" won't be written to appp config if
  no login/passwd is entered (when no authent. is required).

2.0.3
-----

* mofidifed way of saving flags (on/off switches) => it might be
  necessary to adjust your configuration settings.
  Make sure you reselect "PPP" in interface/sanaII if you want
  the default settings to be used for appp.device
* it is now possible to add more than two nameservers by using
  a list.
* the same applies for domain names.
* removed MailServer, NewsServer, ProxyServer and IRCServer
  (were some leftovers from netconnect 1).
* moved "CarrierDetect" to interface/ppp section where it belongs.
* Database section got a cycle gadget to select active page.
* added XonXoff, RadBoogie, OwnDevUnit support.

2.0.4  (21.03.98)
-----------------

* moved interface configuration stuff into separate window.
* moved user configuration stuff into separate window.
* added ppp specific options in interface section (gui only !).
* transfered database/passwd into user section. WARNING: passwd
  will get overwritten !! Create backup first !

2.1.4 (04.04.98)
----------------

* removed "mail login", "mail passwd", "email addr" and
  "mail server" from user section since these are client specific
  entries. Now user information is only stored in amitcp:db/passwd
  and no longer in genesis.conf. => restore passwd from your backup
  and check your user settings (for the last time :)
* skipped some revision numbers to equalize it with genesis since
  it is necessary to use corresponding versions of genesis and prefs.
* "change password" and "remove password" in user section now work again.
* about window now has snapshot gadget and is larger by default.
* owndevunit will be handled by the dialler only => appp config file no
  longer contains "owndevunit yes".
* changed lame grouppager.mcc code into superiour code =>
  much faster, much smaller, less buggy.
* dynamic/static cycle gadgets now work for destination, gateway and
  netmask too.
* "startup" and "shutdown" can be cli command, dos script, arexx script
  or workbench command. unfortunately the first two characters are
  dropped from previous configs => check again in "options/execute".
* switched on code optimisation: smaller, faster code.
* sorry for all the inconveniences.. I think it was the last time ;)

2.1.5 (06.04.98)
----------------

* merged contents of user-edit window into one page.
* added checkbox to enable/disable callback.
* changed connect timeout from string into popup-slider.

2.1.6 (20.04.98)
----------------

* some minor internal changes.

2.1.7 (30.04.98)
----------------

* added support for appp.device's xonxoff and 7wire options
* some minor gui enhancements
* when user name is changed and homedir is still empty then homedir
  will automatically be filled.
* when homedir is changed, it will check if the dir already exists.
* when new user is added, next free user id will be used automatically.
* user passwd can only be changed when old passwd is entered.
* password must now be at least 6 chars long and contain one digit or
  one of those : - / % & + , . ; : $ ! < >    (security reasons)
* merged "rts/cts" and "xon/xoff" checkmarks into a cycle gadget.

2.1.8 (04.05.98)
----------------

* added possibility to set get-time and save-time in isp section.

2.1.9 (07.06.98)
----------------

* moved back from stormc to sasc => 27% smaller code..
* localized everything and added bubble help
* "CliName" wasn't included in the inetd database.
* moved some internal functions to genesis.lib => requires at least
  genesis.library from 7.6.1998
* minor changes/rearrangements in the gui (options section).
* a passwd can only be changed now when the old passwd is entered.
* a passwd can only be removed when the user enters the root passwd.

2.1.10 (22.06.98)

-----------------

* added "import nc 1 config" (see menu)

2.1.12 (05.07.98)
-----------------

* modified about & copyright texts. included "thanks to" part. If someone
  thinks (s)he has been missed, please let me know.

2.1.13 (06.07.98)
-----------------

* added another page in interface window: Exec . there you can add events
  that should be executed when: iface is put online, failed to go online,
  is put offline by user (actively), went offline by itself (passively).
* "always online" is now "auto online", see genesis.txt.
* added options so user can choose if inetd, lo0 and tcp: should be loaded
  at startup (see options/misc).
* removed bug that created corrupt ppp config files.  <shame>
* eof mode was wrong way around.. when selected "off" it was on. <more shame>

2.2.0 (09.07.98)
----------------

* full version for NC2
* demo version does no longer timeout. It's enough if Genesis does.
* corrected error in iface config parameter database (ariadne)

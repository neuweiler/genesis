 2. Bogomil (May  6 05:44): ich habe nachwievor noch das problem, daß nach connect-disconnect-connect kein ping zu einem rechner im lan möglich ist.
Prefs:
======

* "copy" button for providers, ifaces, users
* add possibility to set default gateway

Dialer:
========

* DON'T CALL ANY bsdsocket.lib call when SocketBase == NULL !!!! check everything !!!!
* wenn quit mit iface online und sanaII device nicht oeffnen => kein SocketBase aber syslog() wird in sana.c sana_offline() aufgerufen
* when quit an still online => requester "you're still online, really wanna quit ?"
* quick reconnect (crash => modem stays online, reuse connection)
* close gadget => option so it will iconify instead of quit
* menus to switch "show buttons", etc..
* if OpenDevice() fails, flush the memory and try once again to open it. This will fix this problem.

Amigainfo: What I do in Genesis prefs is that there is a new config window "Autostart" (example) where I can select one or several providers, set some options for how Genesis will be started. Then GenesisPrefs creates the file "Genesis_startup" which is executed from User-Startup with an IF Exists...
(AmigaInf Well, what I would souugest is that the it will be possible to have a local database for a Provider (actually it should probably be renamed to Network. The global is just a database.
(AmigaInf Also Modem should be able to handla multiple modems and then I select which one within the Network configureation.
(AmigaInf So the Network configurations will actually become full configurations with their own files

Wizard:
=======


misc:
=====

* send "RESET" to AmiTCP when SavePrefs, ChangeISP
* loginscript: add "ParseIP", "ParseNextPasswd" (bogomil)
* create small proggy like bootpconfig so Genesis won't be required

MUI Problems could be caused by:
================================

* no GroupInit/ExitChange
* forgot one of the above
* ColGroup() with unfilled columns
* ShowMe in ColGroup


Chris' Extra "ToDo's"
=====================
14. Create a shortcut icon (like Win95/98) for new ISP's in a drawer. ie.
    AmiTCP:Providers/Demon.info.
    A user could leave this .info file on WB and, when executed, would load
    Genesis and go online automatically - also a user and other options could
    be setup within tooltypes.
16. Change GenesisPrefs' menus so that "Import" is renamed to "Import Provider"
    and add an option into menu to "Export Provider".
    I also reckon you should add a RMB menu to the "networks" so that you could
    add/remove/import/export/rename a provider via the RMB menu.

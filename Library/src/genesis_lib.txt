History of genesis.library
--------------------------

2.0.0 (12.5.98)
---------------

* completely new api.
* first release that works with users defined in amitcp:db/passwd.
* added window for user authentication.

2.0.1 (15.5.98)
---------------

* added popup list for usernames
* now only users get loaded into userlist that aren't disabled.

2.0.2 (03.6.98)
---------------

* added functions ReadFile() and WriteFile() since they're used
  internally anyway
* corrected nasty bug: when setting global user the usergroup.lib
  was opened but the lib base pointer wasn't set => for amitcp
  stuff the user was always 'nobody'.
* enabled compiler optimizer => smaller code

2.0.3 (05.6.98)
---------------

* added an argument to GetUser(): title, which allows you to place
  some text into the requester. Please refer to the doc or test.c
* removed argument "app" from GetUser() since not enogh registers
  were available. this value can be extracted from the given
  window object anyway.
* modified GetGlobalUser() api. no arguments are required anymore.
  will return user if globaluser is set or NULL => no longer opens
  user requester automatically. this allows to check if globaluser
  is set without opening a req. You can use GetUser() and
  SetGlobalUser() instead.

2.0.4 (07.06.98)
----------------

* now GetUser() opens muimaster.library itself and creates its own
  mui application to create the login requester. This solves the
  problem with crashes (hopefully) and also allows non-mui
  applications to use the login requester.
* as a result the number of arguments passed to GetUser shrinked
  and "username" and "title" are passed in different registers.
  => correct your application's code (remove MUIMasterBase pointer
  and the pointer to your mui window and recompile).
* added new argument to GetUser() : flags. Please refer to
  libraries/genesis.h for possible values.

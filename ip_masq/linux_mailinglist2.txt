I'm glad you brought this up :).

This has not been true since CIDR (Classless Inter Domain Routing)
came in and the traditional uses of classes (ie. Class A, Class B,
Class C) went out.

Using all definable subnets (that is, using subnet 0 and subnet -1)
has been the current standards-based practice for almost three years
now.
RFC 1878 (December 1995) says "Many vendors only support subnetting
based upon this [excluding all-zeros and all-ones subnets] premise.
This practice is obsolete!  Modern software will be able to utilize
all definable networks."  Note that "modern" in 1995 is old now :).
Also, RFC 1812 (June 1995) says "Previous versions of this document
also noted that subnet numbers must be neither 0 nor -1, and must be
at least two bits in length.  In a CIDR world, the subnet number is
clearly an extension of the network prefix and cannot be interpreted
without the remainder of the prefix.  This restriction of subnet
numbers is therefore meaningless in view of CIDR and may be safely
ignored."

Hmmm, I say that if you have routers that do not comply with the
Internet Standards from mid-1995 then the routers probably have other
problems besides not being able to use subnet 0 & -1, and they should
be upgraded anyway.

Sounds like fun :).
(psst, if you need help subnetting on partial octet boundaries and
want a cheat sheet then see RFC 1878: "Variable Length Subnet Table
For IPv4")

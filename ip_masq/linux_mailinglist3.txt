Re: "Connecting a LAN to the Internet using IP Masquerading"
Just a minor thing, and now that I have made a presentation about it I don't
have an excuse to ignore it, in Geoffreys examples, the subnet should be
10.<0.1>.0 not 10.<0.0>.0 with a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0.
Remember that a subnet value of all binary zeros is classed as "this"
subnetwork, not a valid subnet. Remember 2^8 = 256 - 2 = 254, where subnet 0 and
subnet 255 are the invalid subnets (the minus 2 part).
Technically, you are able to use subnet 0, as long as all the routers in
the internetwork understand subnet zero. I like to think of it as a pocket knife
subnet, the one you pull out when you have used up all your other subnets, and
desperately need one more.
The problem is that you have to check that all devices doing any sort of
routing will support subnet zero, which could take some time, particularly if
you have a large number of routers, running different versions of the routing
software.
BTW, the exam will be at the end of the next meeting. Pass mark is 80%, and you
will be expected to be able to subnet on a partial octet boundary. The exam
will last 1 hour.
HTH,
Mark.

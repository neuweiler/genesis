History for GenesisWizard
=========================

2.0.2 (19.04.98)
----------------

* pages are now built at startup and no longer dynamically.
  this improoves speed and eliminates problems when switching
  pages but eats much more memory.
* removed modem-detect since it caused more trouble than it
  helped (e.g. isdn) and only 7 modem types were supported.
* added page #2 to choose between modem/direct connection.


2.0.3 (27.04.98)
----------------

* readded all those fancy wiz-pics again.. minor growth of
  filesize :)
* removed "isp info" pages. if the ip, gateway / destination
  or DNS addresses are unknown before iface is put online
  then requesters will appear (in the future).
* added a page to enter sanaII configuration details (config
  file and interface parameters).

2.1.0 (30.04.98)
----------------

* ready for beta testing again.. (especially sanaII section)
* now requesters will popup when one of those is missing:
  ip addr, gateway addr, dns addr, hostname, domainname
* env:apppdns1 was not deleted (misspelled filename in DeleteFile())
  and thus they were probably reused after switching the provider config.

2.1.1 (04.05.98)
----------------

* If gateway or dns were given manually, they will be shown properly now
  in the display-config-window.
* temporarely added debug information.. to locate the point where ominous
  crashes occur (no enforcer hits, only one big bang).

2.1.2 (12.05.98)
----------------

* moved back from stormc to sasc => 12% smaller code..
* modem now gets hungup with a dtr drop.
* you can go back now and retry the login procedure.
* corrected minor bug in saving prefs file.

2.1.3 (07.06.98)
----------------

* localized everything, reworked catalog file.
* now also pops up a requester when dest-ip is missing for point2point
  device.
* config details now get displayed in a different way (and printed).
* moved some functions to genesis.library => use genesis.library from
  7.6.1998 or later.

2.1.4 (24.06.98)
----------------

* included support for netconnect.library
* now it's possible to go on if modem doesn't report "OK" on AAT or
  user entered init string.
* if user wasn't defined in db/passwd when savin config, it is beeing
  added and a home directory is created (amitcp:home/loginname).
* the wizard now respects settings that were previously stored with
  genesisprefs/wizard: baudrate, modemname, initstring, etc.

2.1.5 (01.07.98)
----------------

* when wizard adds user to db/passwd, it tells genesis.library to
  reload the userdatabase.
* as a workaround "ATZ\r" is beeing sent before the init-string. this should
  help to avoid problems with some crappy modems.

2.1.6 (05.07.98)
----------------

* modified about & copyright texts. included "thanks to" part. If someone
  thinks (s)he has been missed, please let me know.
* added Delay(10); after each command that's sent to the modem. could fix
  problems with pace modem.
* fixed enforcer hit when moving back from loginscript recorder and forward
  again. caused by pending serial read request which wasn't killed when
  moving back.
* removed help button since we don't have any amigaguide help file.

2.1.7 (06.07.98)
----------------

* eof mode and all compressions are now disabled to provide max. compatibility
  with providers, modems and serial cards.

2.2.0 (09.07.98)
----------------

* full version for NC2
* no longer pops up "try to access net now" req in demo mode => hangs up
  immediately.
* does no longer timeout. it's enough if genesis does.

2.2.1 (03.08.98)
----------------

* changed dial sequence so it should work with those modems which refused to
  dial.
* dropped BOOTP support. will be replaced with DHCP in next rel.

2.3.0 (24.9.98) Italian amiga show
---------------

* bootp in again.
* about window now says if program was compiled for NC
* added support for genesis' own keyfile system.

2.3.1 (30.9.98)
---------------

* if after CONNECT no CD is present => don't set "CD" or "cd yes" in
  sana2 config files. => should now work with modems that don't support
  CD.
